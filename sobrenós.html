<p id="fusionreborn">The movie starts with the Other World Tournament going on and Goku has defeated Froug while Pikkon defeated Arqua. At the Check-In Station, Saike Demon is guarding the Soul Cleansing Machine, but is distracted with his heavy metal music. His lack of attention allows the machine to become too full; as a result, the machine explodes, releasing all of the evil energy at once. The young ogre is enveloped in the evil smog and is transformed into a giant, seemingly innocent, monster of incredible power named Janemba. Janemba's first order of business is to place a barrier around the Check-in Station of Other World. This barrier prevents King Yemma from maintaining order between realms. With Yemma trapped, the souls of Other World are free to return to the land of the living. On Earth, Videl receives a message of distress and she and Gohan go take care of it. <br>
    In Other World, Goku and Pikkon were fighting in the finals of the Other World Tournament, but then are called to go to King Yemma and see what is going on. When they arrive, King Yemma informed them that the monster that did all of this was on the roof of the check-in station. Both Goku and Pikkon are surprised by the tremendous size of Janemba. Goku is excited about his power and lures Janemba to Hell so that Pikkon can start working on the barrier. Once arriving in Hell, Goku is shocked to find it has been changed into a psychedelic, weird world filled with colorful stones. Pikkon attempts to break the barrier, and Goku begins fighting Janemba. <br>
    On Earth, Frieza arrives shortly after Gohan and Videl get rid of a large group of zombies, and Frieza is flattered that a stranger like Gohan knows him. However, Gohan states they fought on Namek, as Frieza then recognizes Gohan as Goku's son. Gohan confirms this by introducing himself with a short speech and dance, saying "I am son of Goku, guardian of all that is good." Deciding the boy should pay for his father's "sins", Frieza sends his army of villains to attack the couple, but Gohan flies through them all and silences him by punching Frieza in the stomach and blowing the tyrant away with an energy shot to the gut. Frieza's terrified minions quickly disperse. Afterward, Gohan does his Justice Pose 1. Mr. Satan is winning over the zombies and happy that they are enemies that he can <br>
    Bulma and the others gather the Dragon Balls, and summon Shenron. They wish for all the souls to return to the underworld, but Shenron informs them that he can send them back, but there is nothing stopping them from coming back, and that something is wrong in Other World.<br>
    In Other World, Pikkon discovers that cursing at the barrier causes it to break. Janemba uses its strange powers such as creating a portal to punch through that leads right to Goku and forming a perfect replica of Goku in his hand, complete with its own Kamehameha. Even as a Super Saiyan 2, Goku is losing until he then powers up to Super Saiyan 3 to defeat the monster. However, Janemba then transforms into a smaller, more powerful form. Back on Earth, Goten and Trunks battle The Dictator and his army and they both go Super Saiyan.<br>
    Goku battles Super Janemba and is overwhelmed after being hit a Hell Gate. Super Janemba then makes a sword from an ogre club he finds on the ground and starts to easily beat Goku with a swing from his sword, creating a dangerously sharped blade of thin air. He then traps him in a triangular cage made from Blood Pond, and then cuts it down to fit Goku. Vegeta comes to help Goku and starts to fight Super Janemba in his Super Saiyan 2 form, but is no match for him. Vegeta was thrown into a cage of spikes, but Goku catches him in time and they both take cover into the cage of spikes. Goku knows they cannot win as separate entities, so he suggests using the fusion technique. Vegeta becomes skeptical, first off that the pose for the Fusion Dance is embarrassing, and furthermore tells him he would rather die than to fuse with a low-class Saiyan. But Goku calmly states that Vegeta is already dead. Goku persuades him to agree, and then they try the Fusion Dance. Vegeta agrees, however, he fails to extend his index finger at the last second, and Veku (as named by South Kai) is created. Veku is weak and can do little but fart on Super Janemba's face and use his Rabbit Feet Technique to run away. Right when Super Janemba is about to destroy him, the fusion runs out and Goku and Vegeta escape.<Br>
        Vegeta curses Goku, saying fusion is useless, but King Kai telepathically points out that it is Vegeta's fault because his index finger was made into a fist and created the blimp Veku. Pikkon then comes to fight Janemba to give Goku and Vegeta more time to perform the fusion. Pikkon figures that Janemba is made of the same material as the barrier and begins cursing at it. Surprisingly, it works, and the creature is caught completely by surprise. However, it is able to incapacitate Pikkon, although those precious few seconds allowed Goku and Vegeta to perform the Fusion Dance, which is successful, forming Gogeta. On Earth, Goten and Trunks sense their dads fusing, and also fuse to create Gotenks. Gogeta is formed, and he defeats Janemba with his ultimate attack: the Stardust Breaker. As a result, the teenage ogre returns. Scared by Gogeta, he runs away, and Gogeta lets out a giggle. Gotenks defeats The Dictator's army with the Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack in one shot. Gogeta defuses, Goku and Vegeta say farewell to each other as Vegeta returns to his spirit form. Hell is returned to normal, All of the souls return to Other World, and King Yemma is freed with lots work to do.<br>
        On Earth, Gohan, Goten, Videl, and Trunks are returning home. Goten and Trunks know who it was that saved them, but refuse to tell anyone. (In the English version, Goten and Trunks were spying on them and joked about Gohan and Videl kissing and being chased home by a crossed Gohan and an embarrassed Videl.) Meanwhile, Shenron remains summoned and asks if anyone still wants to use their wishes, sounding impatient.<br></p>
